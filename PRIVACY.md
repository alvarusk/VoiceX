# Privacy Policy — VoiceX

**Last updated:** January 5, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how VoiceX (the “App”) handles information when you use voice features.

## 1) Data Controller / Contact

- **Controller:** Álvaro J  
- **Contact email:** a.jimeno87@gmail.com

## 2) What data VoiceX may process

Depending on how you use the App and your settings, VoiceX may process:

- **Microphone audio:** only when you enable voice recording or speech features.
- **Transcribed text:** the text produced from speech-to-text (and, if applicable, voice commands or dictated content).
- **App settings:** language, preferences, and local configuration.
- **Diagnostics (optional):** basic technical information to troubleshoot issues (e.g., device type, app version, crash logs). This does not include the content of your dictation unless you explicitly send it to support.

VoiceX is not intended to collect sensitive personal data (health, financial, etc.). Please do not use the App to share highly sensitive information.

## 3) How we use data

We use information to:

- Provide the core functionality of the App (voice capture, transcription, related actions).
- Maintain and improve the App (e.g., bug fixes and stability) when diagnostics are enabled.

## 4) Local processing and third-party services

- **Local processing:** when possible, VoiceX processes and stores data on your device.
- **Cloud services (if you enable them):** if you configure or enable a cloud speech/AI provider, the audio and/or text needed to generate results may be transmitted over the internet to that provider to perform the service.  
  - Third-party providers process data under their own terms and privacy policies.  
  - VoiceX does not control that provider’s retention or downstream use; please review the provider’s policies.

## 5) Sharing of data

VoiceX does not sell your personal data.

We only share data when:

- It is required to provide a service you requested (e.g., the cloud provider you configured).
- It is required to comply with legal obligations.

## 6) Data retention

- **On-device:** any saved recordings/transcripts (if enabled) remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.
- **Cloud providers (if used):** retention depends on the provider you configured and your settings with them.

## 7) Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. Where cloud services are used, encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) are used when supported by the provider.

## 8) Your choices and rights

You can:

- Deny microphone permission (the App cannot transcribe speech without it).
- Disable cloud features (if available) and use local-only functionality where supported.
- Delete App data (e.g., history/transcripts) from within the App (if available) or by uninstalling the App.

To request access, correction, or deletion of data we control, contact: **a.jimeno87@gmail.com**.  
Note: if you use cloud providers, you may also need to exercise rights directly with that provider.

## 9) Children

VoiceX is not directed to children under 13.

## 10) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in features or legal requirements. The “Last updated” date above indicates the latest version.
